### 3. Bootstrap a project

After installing plugins, scaffold your project with domain-specific docs, CLAUDE.md files, and templates:

```
/coordinator:bootstrap-project my-project
```

This delegates to each installed agent's bootstrap skill, creating a `docs/` structure with per-domain documentation and conventions. Idempotent — safe to re-run after adding new plugins.

## Thinking skills — the core of the marketplace

The `thinking` plugin is the most important piece. It provides structured reasoning skills, a learning system that improves over time, and project bootstrapping. Install it first.

```
/plugin install thinking@hpsgd
```

### Reasoning skills

Invoke with `/thinking:skill-name` or let Claude auto-invoke when the context matches.

| Skill | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `/thinking:algorithm` | Seven-phase execution: observe → think → plan → adapt → execute → verify → learn | Any non-trivial task that benefits from systematic execution |
| `/thinking:isc` | Decompose into Identifiable, Specific, Verifiable Criteria | Start of any task — ensures nothing is missed |
| `/thinking:first-principles` | Deconstruct to fundamental truths, challenge assumptions, rebuild | When stuck or challenging inherited constraints |
| `/thinking:council` | Structured debate between 4 expert perspectives | Weighing options, making decisions |
| `/thinking:red-team` | Adversarial stress-testing of an idea or plan | Validating a decision before committing |
| `/thinking:creative` | Divergent ideation with wild card options | Need novel solutions or multiple distinct approaches |
| `/thinking:iterative-depth` | Multi-lens analysis from different perspectives | Requirements analysis, architecture decisions |
| `/thinking:scientific-method` | Goal → hypothesise → experiment → measure → iterate | Debugging, validating assumptions |
| `/thinking:reconcile-rules` | Review learned rules against marketplace rules for overlap | Reducing context bloat from duplicate rules |

### Learning system

The thinking plugin includes a self-improving learning loop that analyses your sessions, detects corrections, and writes rules to prevent repeated mistakes.

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/thinking:retrospective full` | Analyse transcripts, classify signals, detect patterns, generate metrics, write learned rules |
| `/thinking:retrospective latest` | Analyse the most recent completed session |
| `/thinking:retrospective summary` | Show accumulated metrics and correction rate trends |
| `/thinking:retrospective patterns` | Detect recurring correction patterns across sessions |
| `/thinking:retrospective signals` | Classify ambiguous messages and evolve regex patterns |
| `/thinking:learning` | Capture a learning in the moment (manual) |
| `/thinking:wisdom` | Record or query crystallised patterns from accumulated experience |
| `/thinking:health-check` | Audit the project's Claude Code setup — plugins, rules, memory, learnings |
| `/thinking:review-settings` | Audit settings.json files for broad permissions, overlaps, and redundancy |
| `/thinking:propose-improvement` | Propose a PR against the marketplace based on a detected pattern |

**How the learning loop works:**

```
Every message → regex classifier (async, ~5ms) → correction/praise/unclassified
                                                          ↓
New session start → analyse previous transcript → extract corrections/reversals
                  → detect patterns (3+ instances) → generate metrics
                  → inject recent learnings into context (so Claude remembers)
                                                          ↓
/thinking:retrospective → Claude classifies ambiguous signals
                        → writes learned rules to .claude/rules/ (immediate effect)
                        → evolves regex patterns (self-improving)
                        → proposes upstream PRs when patterns mature (5+ instances)
```

## Agent overview

```

Each agent has specialised skills, templates, and a bootstrap skill for project scaffolding. The coordinator's `bootstrap-project` skill orchestrates all agents, assembles a tech context from your installed language plugins, and confirms it before scaffolding. Install only what you need — each agent is a separate plugin.

## How it works

### Two approaches to sharing instructions

Claude Code plugins natively support **tools, agents, skills, and output styles**. But team **instructions** (coding standards, security rules, writing guidelines) need a different mechanism. This marketplace uses two complementary approaches:

#### 1. Rules (installed via hook)

For instructions that should **always be active** — coding conventions, security baselines, writing style. These are `.md` files in each plugin's `rules/` directory. A `SessionStart` hook automatically copies them into your project's `.claude/rules/` directory with a namespace prefix (e.g., `coding-standards--typescript.md`).

**Best for:** org-wide standards, conventions, compliance rules

#### 2. Skills (auto-invoked by context)

For instructions that apply **in specific contexts** — code review checklists, security audit procedures, PR templates. These are skills that Claude auto-invokes when the context matches.

**Best for:** workflow-specific guidance, path-specific rules, on-demand tools

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| "Always follow these TypeScript conventions" | Rule (installed) |
| "When reviewing code, check for X" | Skill (auto-invoked) |
| "Use this tone in all communications" | Rule (installed) |
| "When working on API files, follow these patterns" | Skill with `paths:` filter |
| "Security checklist for all PRs" | Skill (invoked during review) |

### The learning system

The thinking plugin includes hooks that fire on every session:

- **`UserPromptSubmit` (async)** — classifies every user message via regex. Catches corrections, praise, and approach changes. Queues ambiguous messages for Claude to classify during `/thinking:retrospective`.
- **`SessionStart`** — analyses the previous session's transcript, detects patterns, generates metrics, and injects recent learnings into context.

Learnings flow through two paths:

1. **Path 1 (local, immediate):** Learned rules written to `.claude/rules/learned--*.md` take effect next session.
2. **Path 2 (shared, upstream):** When patterns recur (5+ instances), `/thinking:propose-improvement` proposes a PR against the marketplace repo with evidence.

The regex classifier is self-evolving — each retrospective that classifies an ambiguous message extracts a new regex pattern and writes it to `.claude/learnings/signals/patterns.json`, which the classifier loads on every subsequent message.

## Evaluation framework

Every plugin definition is tested against a calibrated evaluator. Tests live in `examples/` mirroring the plugin structure, and each contains a realistic prompt, criteria, a simulated output showing what the skill would produce, and a per-criterion evaluation.

Run evaluations with the `/evaluate` skill:

```
/evaluate                                          # all 173 tests
/evaluate examples/research                        # one category
/evaluate examples/research/analyst/skills/company-lookup.md  # single test
```

Current results: **173 tests, 173 PASS.** Scores range from 81% to 100% across all categories. Research tests are grounded in real data (real companies, public figures, real articles) and enforce source citation quality (deep links, access dates).

Full results in `examples/REPORT.md`.

## Troubleshooting

### marketplace.json source paths

Plugin source paths in `marketplace.json` must be prefixed with `./plugins/` (the full relative path from the repo root). Do NOT use `pluginRoot` in metadata — it doesn't resolve correctly with local directory marketplaces.

```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "source": "./plugins/engineering/my-plugin"
}
```

### Skills not available via `/` slash commands

Plugin skills are invoked by Claude automatically (when the description matches the context) or by asking Claude to use them (e.g., "audit all agents using the plugin-curator"). The `/plugin-name:skill-name` slash command syntax may not work for all plugin-provided skills. This is a Claude Code limitation, not a marketplace issue.

## Creating a new plugin

1. Create the plugin directory under the appropriate category:

   ```
   plugins/leadership/my-leader/       # Coordination and C-level agents
   plugins/product/my-product-agent/   # Customer-facing, product, design, content
   plugins/engineering/my-eng-agent/   # Technical implementation agents
   plugins/practices/my-practice/      # Standards, methodology, cross-cutting rules
   plugins/research/my-research/       # Research, analysis, investigation agents
   ```

   Plugin structure:

   ```
   plugins/<category>/<name>/
   ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json   # Required
   ├── skills/                      # Optional
   │   └── my-skill/SKILL.md
   ├── agents/                      # Optional
   │   └── my-agent.md
   ├── rules/                       # Optional: installed into projects
   │   └── my-rules.md
   ├── templates/                   # Optional: reference templates
   └── hooks/                       # Optional: if you have rules to install
       └── hooks.json
   ```

2. If your plugin has rules, add the install hook in `hooks/hooks.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "SessionStart": [
         {
           "matcher": "startup",
           "hooks": [
             {
               "type": "command",
               "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../../scripts/install-rules.sh \"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}\" \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\""
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is automatically set by Claude Code to the plugin's installation directory. `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` points to the consuming project's root.

3. Register the plugin in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-plugin",
     "source": "agents/my-plugin",
     "description": "What it does",
     "version": "0.1.0",
     "category": "agents",
     "tags": ["relevant", "tags"]
   }
   ```

4. Update this README with usage instructions.

## Customization

### Per-project overrides

Projects can override marketplace rules by creating their own `.claude/rules/` files. Project-level rules take precedence.

### Disabling specific plugins

Remove or set to `false` in your project's `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "writing-style@hpsgd": false
  }
}
```

### Local overrides (not committed)

Use `.claude/settings.local.json` for personal preferences that shouldn't affect the team:

```json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "coding-standards@hpsgd": false
  }
}
```
